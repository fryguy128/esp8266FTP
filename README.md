FTPESP8266.ino modifies SurferTim's FTP code (http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/FTP) to work with the esp8266 chip.This only contains the functionality to modify then upload a file to your server but additional functionality could easily be added by modifying the code starting at line 148. Functionality would be implemented usingraw FTP commands. A list of such commands can be found at: http://www.nsftools.com/tips/RawFTP.htm
